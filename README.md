## Folium Map in Streamlit: Co-op Locations

This Streamlit application visualizes the locations of various cooperatives on a map. Users can view details and search for specific co-ops using the built-in search tool.

### Setup & Run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the repository directory.
3. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install streamlit pandas folium geojson streamlit_folium
   ```
4. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app_filename.py
   ```

Replace `app_filename.py` with the name of the Python file containing the code.

### Code Overview

The provided Python script utilizes libraries such as Streamlit, pandas, folium, and geojson. The co-op data is read from a CSV file hosted on GitHub. The application filters and processes this data, converting it into GeoJSON format to be visualized on a folium map.

The map provides interactivity, allowing users to view details of each co-op by clicking on its marker. A search feature is also available for users to quickly locate specific co-ops by name.

### What are Co-ops?

Cooperatives (co-ops) are member-owned and member-governed businesses that operate for the benefit of their members according to common principles agreed upon by the international cooperative community. They can exist in various sectors including agriculture, finance, and retail.

### How Co-ops Support a Regenerative Economy

A regenerative economy is an economic system that works to regenerate, revitalize, and restore its own sources of energy and materials. Co-ops play a crucial role in such an economy by:

1. **Promoting Sustainable Practices:** Co-ops often prioritize long-term sustainability over short-term profits, making environmentally friendly decisions.
2. **Community Focus:** By being owned and controlled by their members, co-ops ensure that business decisions benefit the community, leading to local development and regeneration.
3. **Reinvestment:** Profits made by co-ops are often reinvested in the community or returned to their members, promoting local economic growth and sustainability.
4. **Inclusive Decision-Making:** The democratic structure of co-ops ensures that decisions are made for the benefit of all members, fostering a sense of community and shared purpose.

By integrating cooperatives into our economic models, we can move towards a more sustainable, inclusive, and regenerative future.
